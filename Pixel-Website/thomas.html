         <h3>Path of Exile</h3>
         <p>A game about slaying tons and tons of monsters hoping they drop the items you're looking for on death, then to inevitably try again when they don't, only getting that precious hit of dopamine when they finally do and then quickly forgetting about it the second you pick it up. An ultimate struggle in futility that I love and is free to play*.
            <p>*It's free if you like your characters being ugly, and if you don't mind dealing with the horrible default storage system.</p>

         <h3>Crusader Kings III</h3>
            <p>Did you ever want to be a medieval ruler and conquer Europe? Well Crusader Kings III makes that possible and more! Live out your fantasy of owning a cat and then slowly watching it die of old age and then getting depressed. Send your son(s) and/or daughter(s) to war only to see them violently killed in a battle that was ultimately forgotten to history. Watch as a carefully laid out plan to make your favorite child your successor fail as he or she accidentally gets bitten by a venomous snake in the night in their own bed in a totally not suspicious occurence, only to then realize the next child up for the throne is a craven lunatic with the worst stats you can possibly imagine. It's a great time in medieval Europe*. 
               <p>*Note: it's only a great time if you're rich and powerful, those who are not do not have a great time.</p>
